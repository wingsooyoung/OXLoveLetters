**CREDITS:**
*This project would not exist if not for these websites/examples listed below!!! Nearly all of my web development experience is self taught, and without all these amazing tutorials and resources I would be nowhere.* 

1. This Netlify example site showing how to take in form input and populate the comment template with the form's data -> [HERE](https://jamstack-comments.netlify.app/posts/no-performance-bottlenecks/)

2. This basic HTML form app on Glitch that shows how to use form data input -> [HERE](https://glitch.com/~learn-forms-get-started) 
 > Glitch example found on web dev's Learn Forms! section -> [HERE](https://web.dev/learn/forms/form-element/)

3. W3schools, yes the entire website, who I would be lost without -> [HERE](https://www.w3schools.com/)

4. [Sketchbook](https://www.sketchbook.com/), which I downloaded several years ago when it was released for free and still under Autodesk, and [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/?utm_source=homescreen), the web-based photo editor putting Adobe Photoshop to SHAME, and also [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), for helping me create the postcard design 

Special shout out to Intellij's WebStorm (I hate that you're not free though) and the Doki Theme plugin, because coding with a Hastune Miku layout makes me work better :)
